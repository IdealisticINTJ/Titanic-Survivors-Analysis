## Data Analysis and Prediction of Survivors on the Titanic Dataset

## Overview

### Kaggle Competition | Titanic Machine Learning from Disaster
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. 

Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking ship, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.

Here, we try to analyze which factors were more likely to contribute to the death of the passengers and classify who is more likely to survive depending on these features.

This Kaggle Getting Started Competition provides an ideal starting place for people who may not have a lot of experience in data science and machine learning.
